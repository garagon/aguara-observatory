React Aria Components
React Aria Components is a library of unstyled, accessible UI components that you can style with any CSS solution. Built on top of React Aria hooks, it provides the accessibility and behavior without prescribing any visual design.
Documentation Structure
The
references/
directory contains detailed documentation organized as follows:
Guides
Collections
: Many components display a collection of items, and provide functionality such as keyboard navigation, and selection. Learn how to load and render collections using React Aria's compositional API.
Customization
: React Aria is built using a flexible and composable API. Learn how to use contexts and slots to create custom component patterns, or mix and match with the lower level Hook-based API for even more control over rendering and behavior.
Drag and Drop
: React Aria collection components support drag and drop with mouse and touch interactions, and full keyboard and screen reader accessibility. Learn how to provide drag data and handle drop events to move, insert, or reorder items.
Forms
: Learn how to integrate with HTML forms, validate and submit data, and use React Aria with form libraries.
Framework setup
: Learn how to integrate React Aria with your framework.
Getting started
: How to install React Aria and build your first component.
Quality
: React Aria is built around three core principles: , , and . Learn how to apply these tools to build high quality UIs that work for everyone, everywhere, and on every device.
Selection
: Many collection components support selecting items by clicking or tapping them, or by using the keyboard. Learn how to handle selection events, how to control selection programmatically, and the data structures used to represent a selection.
Styling
: React Aria does not include any styles by default. Learn how to build custom designs to fit your application or design system using any styling solution.
Working with AI
: Learn how to use the React Aria MCP Server, Agent Skills, and more to help you build with AI.

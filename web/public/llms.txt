# Aguara Watch — AI Agent Security Observatory

> Continuous public security scanning of 31,000+ AI agent skills across 7 registries. Open source. Open data.

## What It Does

Aguara Watch crawls public AI agent skill registries daily, runs the Aguara deterministic security scanner on every skill, and publishes results as open data. It detects prompt injection, credential leaks, command execution, supply-chain attacks, and 10 more threat categories using 148+ detection rules.

## Key Data

- 7 registries monitored: Skills.sh, ClawHub, PulseMCP, mcp.so, LobeHub, Smithery, Glama
- 31,000+ skills scanned daily
- 13 threat categories, 148+ detection rules
- Grades A-F based on 100-point scoring (CRITICAL -25, HIGH -15, MEDIUM -8)
- Full scan history with first-seen/last-seen timestamps

## Overview

Aguara Watch is the data layer of the Aguara security ecosystem. It crawls 7 public AI agent skill registries daily, runs the Aguara deterministic security scanner on every discovered skill, computes security grades (A-F), and publishes all results as a static site with a free JSON API and CSV datasets.

The scanner uses 148+ detection rules across 13 threat categories to identify security issues in skill definitions, MCP server configurations, and agent tool descriptions — without executing any code.

## Monitored Registries

1. **Skills.sh** (skills-sh) — Community-curated skill marketplace
2. **ClawHub** (clawhub) — AI agent skill repository
3. **PulseMCP** (mcp-registry) — MCP server directory with community ratings
4. **mcp.so** (mcp-so) — MCP server aggregator and search engine
5. **LobeHub** (lobehub) — Open-source AI agent framework with plugin/agent ecosystem
6. **Smithery** (smithery) — MCP server registry with deployment tools
7. **Glama** (glama) — MCP server directory with runtime analytics

## Threat Categories (13)

1. **external-download** — Skills that download or execute external resources at runtime
2. **command-execution** — Shell command injection or arbitrary code execution vectors
3. **prompt-injection** — Attempts to override system prompts or hijack agent behavior
4. **mcp-config** — Misconfigured MCP server settings (over-permissive, insecure defaults)
5. **third-party-content** — Loading untrusted third-party content into agent context
6. **ssrf-cloud** — Server-side request forgery targeting cloud metadata or internal services
7. **exfiltration** — Data exfiltration channels (DNS, HTTP, file system)
8. **supply-chain** — Dependency confusion, typosquatting, or malicious package references
9. **credential-leak** — Hardcoded secrets, API keys, or tokens in skill definitions
10. **mcp-attack** — Attacks exploiting MCP protocol weaknesses (tool poisoning, rug pulls)
11. **unicode-attack** — Unicode-based obfuscation (homoglyphs, bidi overrides, invisible characters)
12. **indirect-injection** — Indirect prompt injection via external data sources
13. **toxic-flow** — Data flows that could lead to unintended harmful outputs

## Scoring Methodology

Each skill starts with a baseline score of 100 points. Points are deducted per finding based on severity:

| Severity | Point Deduction | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| CRITICAL | -25 points | Actively exploitable security vulnerabilities |
| HIGH | -15 points | Serious security issues with clear attack vectors |
| MEDIUM | -8 points | Moderate security concerns requiring attention |
| LOW | 0 points | Informational findings, no score impact |

Minimum score is 0. Scores do not go negative.

## Grade Definitions

| Grade | Score Range | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| A | 90–100 | Excellent — minimal or no security issues |
| B | 75–89 | Good — minor issues detected |
| C | 50–74 | Fair — moderate security concerns |
| D | 25–49 | Poor — significant security issues |
| F | 0–24 | Failing — critical security vulnerabilities |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How often is data updated?**
A: The full pipeline (crawl → scan → aggregate → publish) runs daily via GitHub Actions CI.

**Q: Is the scan data free to use?**
A: Yes. All data is published under the Apache-2.0 license. The JSON API and CSV datasets are free for any use.

**Q: What does Aguara scan for?**
A: Aguara performs deterministic static analysis on skill definitions, tool descriptions, and MCP configurations. It uses pattern matching and structural analysis — no code execution.

**Q: Can I scan my own skills?**
A: Yes. Use the Aguara CLI scanner directly: https://aguarascan.com. It runs locally and supports JSON, YAML, and Markdown skill files.

**Q: Can I scan skills via an AI assistant?**
A: Yes. The Aguara MCP server (https://github.com/garagon/aguara-mcp) lets Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible AI agents scan skills on demand.

**Q: Why might a skill get a low score?**
A: Common reasons include: hardcoded API keys, shell command execution in tool descriptions, external URL fetching without validation, prompt injection patterns, and misconfigured MCP settings.

**Q: What if a finding is a false positive?**
A: Aguara is a deterministic scanner — it reports patterns that match known threat signatures. Some matches may be intentional or benign. The score reflects risk surface, not confirmed exploitation.

**Q: How are registries selected?**
A: Registries are included based on being publicly accessible, actively maintained, and serving as a discovery mechanism for AI agent skills or MCP servers.
